# MachineLearning_Logistic_Regression
Logistic Regression (LR) code to analyze and identify and categorize given set of MNIST fashion images. LR algorithm using SVD for dimension reduction is coded without using external library.

README:

To run execute the program, please follow the below steps:

Step 1: First run 1st block to import numpy and time library.
Step 2: run all the defined functions.
Step 3: run block below Training the Classifier One Vs All to initiate 
the learning procedure of the classifier. It will take approximately 40 minutes to complete the whole training process.
Step 4: run remaining blocks under Testing Procedure to check the outcomes of performance metrics.
